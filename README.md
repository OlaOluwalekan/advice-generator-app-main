**This challenge comprises of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and API**

## Overview

### The challenge

This challenge is to build out an advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The goal is for users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) - Advice API

### What I learned

This challenge gave me an avenue to hone my **HTML** and **CSS** skills. But my major take home from this is integrating **API** with my JavaScrip Code and displaying data from the API into HTML tags.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

I'm particularly happy with my styling of the die image and giving it cool transitions

```css
.die-container {
  background-color: var(--neonGreen);
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  width: var(--dieWidth);
  height: var(--dieWidth);
  border-radius: 50%;
  position: absolute;
  bottom: -32.5px;
  transform: rotate(0deg);
  transition: transform 1s ease;
  cursor: pointer;
  box-shadow: 8px 8px 40px var(--darkerGreyishBlue);
}
```

The code snippet below üëá imports the API into my JavaScript and embed it to my HTML tag

```js
fetch("https://api.adviceslip.com/advice")
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response);
    return response.json();
  })
  .then((data) => {
    let advise = data.slip;
    console.log(advise);
    adviceId.innerHTML = "advise #" + advise.id;
    adviceText.innerHTML = advise.advice;
  });
```

### Continued development

Working with API is still somehoe new to me and at present, I still have to make reference to videos and tutorials to be able to get a grip. Hence, I hope to continue to solidify my knowledge in this ascpect by building more projects that uses API

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me whenever i need to make a quick reference to CSS styles and selectors.
- [Example resource 2](https://youtube.com) - This is an amazing platform for me to watch videos of people who have built something cool with API. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
